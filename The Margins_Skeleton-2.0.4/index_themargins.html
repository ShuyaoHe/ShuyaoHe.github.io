She shows us her artwork, a colorful self portrait of a budding teenager with long brown hair — a reflection she only began seeing in the mirror about a year ago.

        <p class="eight columns">
          At 13 years old, Kimma is already more self-aware than her classmates. Eager to stay informed about the world, she actively watches the news, a program her friends find “sad and depressing.” She worries about who her generation will elect as the next president and if that person will be supportive of the transgender  community, of people like her.

        <p class="eight columns">Sitting in the hospital room post-delivery holding their son, Craig and his wife Jodi still didn’t know what to call their first born.
        </p>
        <p class="eight columns">
          To the outsider, coming to the conclusion of naming their baby boy after his father may seem like an obvious choice, but Craig certainly couldn’t see it — mostly because he had never really liked his own name.

        </p>
        <p class="eight columns">
          “I never thought my name was anything special or terrible so… but I thought well maybe if we name him Craig, I’ll like my name more. In fact, I’ll certainly like my name more.”
        </p>
        <p class="eight columns">
          But Craig’s son didn’t like the name the name he shared with his father. He hated it.</p>
        <p class="eight columns">
          “That was tough because I was feeling like, is there something wrong with me as a person that my son isn’t proud to be associated with me,” an injury that grew larger as his son got older and more uncomfortable in his own body.</p>
          <p class="eight columns">
            According to the American Psychiatric Association, gender dysphoria is, “a conflict between a person’s physical or assigned gender and the gender with which he/she/they identify.” Some children may not express discomfort until puberty or after, while others express feelings and behaviors relating to gender dysphoria at 4 years old or younger.

            Craig’s son was the latter.</p>

       TRANSGENDER IN TRUMP’S AMERICA
     </p></div>
<img src="/The Margins_Skeleton-2.0.4/Screenshot.png"/>
     <p class="eight columns"> Craig’s struggle to adapt to his new family reflects the current political landscape in the U.S. Last year, North Carolina became the first state to restrict which restrooms transgender individuals can use. Though the bill was repealed in March, 16 other states have followed suit, some even include policy proposals specific to public schools, rather than all public facilities, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
     </p>
     <p class="eight columns">
      In July, President Trump tweeted that individuals who identify as transgender are compromising the military, costing the Defense department money, and would not be permitted to serve their country moving forward.
     </p>
     <p class="eight columns">
       “Visibility makes a difference,” Perotti says, “Whenever you talk about a discrimination or marginalization that’s steeped in secrecy and silence, anything that increases visibility makes a difference.”
     </p>
     <p class="eight columns">
      Kimma wholeheartedly agrees, ”Once you get rid of the pressures of society, the pressures of family, and you just listen to yourself, you can figure out who you are -- obviously [things] have become better for me, I have more confidence. I’m not fake, like a billboard [saying], “Oh, this is Craig, but what you don’t know is there’s a crystal behind [him] named Kimma.”
 </p>
     <p class="eight columns">
      Though Trump’s statements are not supported by the Department of Defense, existing law, or any proposed legislation, it’s concerning for transgender people currently serving in the military.
</p>
      <p class="eight columns">
        Craig understands how fortunate they are to live in Massachusetts, a state with strong laws and policies that ensure the rights of all students to be able to attend school free of discrimination or harassment.
</p>
      <p class="eight columns">
        “When you make your school safe for those who are the most vulnerable it really makes it a safe environment for all students,” Perotti adds.
</p>
     <p class="eight columns">
       Though it’s comforting to know Kimma is safe at school, it doesn’t strip Craig of his parental fear -- fear that his daughter may be confronted by transphobia and harmed for something that she struggled to discover and fighting to preserve.
     </p>
     <p class="eight columns">
       Like America, Craig’s progression to Kimma’s transition is gradual. “It’s a process. There’s some days I’m celebratory, sometimes I go back down a few notches and I’m not celebrating it. But I’m [not] rejecting it anymore and I don’t think I’ll ever go back to that.”
